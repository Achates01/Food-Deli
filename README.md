# React + Vite
In this single tutorial you will learn to build a food ordering website / app step by step using React JS. In this React JS project we will create the Home page to display the menu and food items, then cart page and order page. Then we will make the Sign In / Sign Up popup. 
In the next part we will make the back-end and admin panel of this food delivery website / web app. We will make the project full stack with the help of MongoDB, Express, React and Node JS.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
